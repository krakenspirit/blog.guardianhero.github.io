<p>After taking steps to become a registered organization and to acquire a bank account, my bank account was closed involuntarily because of mistakes made when funding the account. I have sense learned that everything in our society is a game they force us to learn how to play with severe consequences when we don’t. Over the next few years, I will learn what my options are, diversifying the risk of relying solely on banks, and ultimately will work to transition away from our current financial system.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency w/Stablecoins, Cash and CashApp (Prepaid Cards) are the two alternatives to traditional banking. I’m not fond of carrying cash. So, to some extent, the game will have to be played. To what extent remains to be unknown.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-economy">Alternative Economy</h2>
<p>I have always loved the concept of a pay-it-forward financial system, where the more kind deeds you do, the more your wealth grows, where anyone can be included. I had this concept of Guardian Points (GP) and Hero Points (HP). We would start with One Million Heroes Campaign, a fundraiser inspired by the one million ads. Participants would receive HP and the developers would receive GP as a measurement of the value they created (a bit like reward points, cash-back programs).</p>

<h2 id="everyone-has-value">Everyone has value</h2>
<p>In my system, value was not just created by those who contributed financially and were “able-bodied”. Stay-at-home parents and caregivers who cared for their loved ones could create value. Gardeners and backyard homesteaders who fed their family and shared the abundance with their neighbors could create value. People who take part in the community create value as their contribution. We could focus on our strengths and interests rather than focusing on how much money will this make us. To spend more time at home with our families, to see them grow.</p>

<h2 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h2>
<p>One system that has inspired me to how this could work has been decentralized blockchain technology (ledgers) - some of which work a lot, like stocks and dividends. The very act of participating in the community secures the network. Banks and even Churches do this too. They use your money to trade, and you get small amounts of interest. Crypto just ‘gives’ you more at the expense of volatility.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cardano (ADA) with its staking, you hold coins; they generate interest.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin (BTC) with its miners, where just by using your computer to mine you secure the network and create coins.</li>
  <li>IOTA’s DAG system and the way its transaction system worked, looks the most like my pay-it-forward system. Where in order to send a ‘transaction’ you must verify and validate two previous transactions.</li>
  <li>Then there is NEM (XEM) a coin with reputation based system.</li>
  <li>Brave (BAT) tokens allow you to generate coins by rewarding your attention - they pay you to view ads - ‘advertisements’ or ‘sponsors’ and then choosing who you would like to give those tokens to - yourself or someone you support. (this is not a new concept, but it doesn’t require you to give up your privacy)</li>
  <li>Monero (XMR) is privacy based, but also really complicated. Something simple like ADA that offers privacy for its users.</li>
  <li>Resource based economy and currencies based on a basket of commodities.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I could merge these concepts together - I could in theory - create a blockchain token that incentivizes actions which uplift each other. What if for every real-world item we created for each other, we linked it to the value of our token? Tokens that could grant access to resources - we provide to others - who help us or others also part of our community. Tokens represent our shared creations, reputation, membership within the community and our responsibility to each other.</p>

<h2 id="hp-vs-gp">HP vs. GP</h2>
<p>It would be like a companies ‘reward points’ except the reward would be - at least for members - a measurement of their time and contribution within the community which enable us to build resources. Production would generate Guardian Points (GP). When given to laymen, they would become Hero Points (HP). HP could purchase any product provided by Guardians and I hoped that someday we could provide help with rent, food, and more.</p>

<h2 id="ledger-systems">Ledger Systems</h2>
<p>Initially, I thought the token-system <em>had</em> to be blockchain based, but I didn’t know how to code or implement that. After going to the farmer’s market, I saw tokens could be wooden or plastic chips. The primary difference is one method is decentralization. Decentralized is better at being censorship resistant, but also could prevent abuses in leadership. Another benefit of blockchain is tokens can represent voting power and governance. This leads to a form of government I’ve been mulling over called Daocracy. But that’s another story altogether.</p>

<h2 id="a-resource-based-economy">A Resource-Based Economy</h2>
<p>Daniel Suelo gave up money and lives his life by upcycling and bartering. Jacque Fresco envisioned a world without money - a resource-based economy - where <em>“all goods and services are available to all people without the need for money, credits, barter or any other means”</em>. In his system, as I understand it, resources are abundant and managed in a decentralized way - perfect for blockchain technology. But how would they manage shortages? I imagine they would ration.</p>

<p>What was life like before money? What is life like for different social-based species who do not have money? Some species are brutal - but - some aren’t. How do the ones who are not brutal handle sharing and rationing resources? There are tribal communities that do not use money, and they share everything with each other. Is this a realistic option? Can they do it on a small-scale, can those small-scales use bridges to interact with other communities? What about property? Can there be a balance between community property vs. individual property? Co-op models seem to be an example of this balance. <em>“A cooperative is “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” It’s owned and controlled by the people who use it, rather than stockholders.”</em>.</p>

<h2 id="designed-for-small-communities">Designed for Small Communities</h2>
<p>Decentralized blockchain technologies don’t have to be launched to support the world. They can support small communities. Cross-community bridges (the same in concept as cross-chain bridges and side chains) could interchange assets to enable interaction with other communities and society as a whole. It would be open-source and perhaps other communities could be built on or with it. The system would be strictly designed for intentional communities and monasteries. And that’s only if it were to be adopted - and - only if we were on our own blockchain rather than using a pre-existing blockchain or Token. On a smaller-scale it would still work even if only we used it.</p>

<h2 id="open-heart-designed">Open Heart designed</h2>
<p>Although inspired by UBI, what I want to create is not the same. The problem I have with UBI is that it’s centralized and linked to a social credit score. The funds can be taken away or blacklisted. In my system, members would have many ways to contribute to society. If they choose not to do one thing, they have other ways to bring value. It is not my way or the highway, it’s all roads can lead to the same destination. Each member would fully own their points and can transfer them or keep them as they please. UBI is given without condition, but my system would have the condition that to receive them you must be a member and each member must be active participants in the network, contributing to the security and growth.</p>

<p>That could mean playing board games with each other, gardening or making jewelry and sharing that excess with others within the community. It could help take care of other members in the community. All these things are contributions whether it involves bringing food to the table. Here, every person has value just by doing their part to strengthen and uplift each other. Those physically disabled, who can’t walk, speak or write, still eat food and generate waste, and we can upcycle waste into fuel, contributing to our circular economy. They can encourage us to evolve and develop technologies that make life easier for each other, not harder, offering us problems to solve in compassionate ways. We can create a community where we add value to the lives of those who love us and incentivize healing and allowing our lives to be a byproduct of healing. Where no one person is expendable.</p>

<h2 id="shelved-idea">Shelved Idea</h2>
<p>My intentions are well-placed. But let’s face it… the logistics, mathematics and intelligence aren’t there yet. I will prototype this concept first with game mechanics among friends, and then we’ll explore its usage within the monastery. If it works, we’ll share it with others. And if it doesn’t, maybe somebody else will build it, or create something that makes our concept obsolete.</p>
