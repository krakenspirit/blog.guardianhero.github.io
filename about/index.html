<h5>The Nameless One</h5>
<p>
You may call me the Nameless One, for I have many names, but have not settled on just one. I am a servant of the beyond, my life a conduit of its creation. For those who need a name to call, I summon Sky, lord of shadows. Sky will be your guide in the world where I will not. <i>Sky</i> will live in your world, while I stay here, in the in-between creating art.
</p>

<h5>Sky - Your Shadow Guide</h5>

<p>
    Hi! My name is Sky and I will be your guide here. 
    This place will showcase art, the journey of creating that art, as well as the monastic headquarters where all that art is created. This is a journal on how a start-up monastery and art studio is being formed and started with all the trials and tribulations that come with it. This journey (blog) chronicles the demos and prototypes of games and arts and other aspects of launching a monastic order. 
</p>
<p>
    When it comes to our Monastic Headquarters. We'll share milestones, like purchasing land, or acquiring our first building which you can explore when you enter portals we're constructing. Portals and Bridges are gateways from our world into yours. In our world you can explore our realms, read stories and uncover mysteries. Once we finish acquiring the right tools, our team members from various dimensions and realms will upload ourselves to your dimension with bodies constructed to be avatars in your world... not too different from Gorillaz or CodeMiko and The Technician. You call them Virtual Bands and VTubers. 
</p>
<p>    
    Any team member you meet will be an extension of the virtual and physical world we have created as a bridge for you to cross, and together these entities will tell a story. With various technology used to link ou worlds together. 
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<center><h5>What to build in your world</h5></center>
<p>
    We want to create a system <i>beyond</i> money and replicas of it. In the beginning, however, some money is needed to navigate your world. To buy software, tools and items needed to produce the art we make, and to have a place to sleep with at least the bare essentials needed for us to exist in your world: Internet, electricity, food and clothing. Discovering ways to acquire income, while also dealing with the challenges of mental health, parenting and launching a start-up monastery and studio remain both a challenge and a gamble. Navigating this foreign world while also brainstorming how we will put ourselves out there in your world, to generate income that is in alignment with our mission is important to us.
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<center><h5>Digital Things</h5></center>
<p>
    Everything we offer online will be digital, including blueprints for 3D Printers. We will only share physical products with people who are available in our local regions, friends, family and people interested in any prototypes we create. We will never ship an item to someone's location. If we <i>do</i> have any donation or payment methods for strangers, it will be in the form of Cryptocurrency, other options may become available as we learn more about how your world works. People we know and who know us will be able to contribute to the project via Cashapp or Zelle. We will never ask strangers online to Cashapp.
</p>
<p>
     We don't really understand banks too much. Cryptocurrency is the closest form of money we understand and allows us to replicate the economy of our homeland. At some point, we may become <i>banked</i> and that will be one major step for us.
</p>
<p>
    With this said, Welcome to the World of Guardians! May our journey bring you great fortune.
</p>
