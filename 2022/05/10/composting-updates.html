            <p><img src="/assets/img/chloe-leis-aqVR9n17ejc-unsplash.jpg" alt="Ducks" title="Ducks" /></p>

<p>Around March 10, 2017, I began working on converting all the waste the monastery produces into building and growing materials via vermicomposting. In 2020, I called it a failure, as the worms required a lot of space and a lot of waste to maintain. In 2019, I switched to Ivory Head Roaches, and in 2020, I added mealworms. This fall of 2022 after my rats died, I added dermestids as well. This year I incorporated Mules (Muscovy x Duck) into the mix with the goal of producing eggs and using duck fertilizer for growing plants.</p>

<p>For the Guardian project I purchased:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hardware Cloth and accessories,</li>
  <li>Mutt Duckling (Muscovy mixes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Harvesting duck and chicken poop requires some planning, but harvesting eggs has been a breeze. The chickens and ducks free range the garden and so far they haven’t been eaten. Males are up for adoption in pairs and trios. I have not ruled out outsourcing to a local butcher known for humane kills. To make the males worth the cost of feeding them, I would have to accept them as pets (or) harvest their poop and find a use for it. They are very good bug patrol but then so are my egg layers. None of the males are fertile.</p>

<h2 id="guardian-philosophy">Guardian Philosophy</h2>
<p>Guardians have a philosophy called “Kashal” which is a precept Guardians follow but not layman. We can’t eat food whose ingredients we don’t recognize, there can’t be more than 5 whole ingredients in a single product, <em>and</em> any animal we eat has to be an animal we have raised ourselves in compassionate conditions or know beyond doubt have been raised in compassionate conditions. They have to be killed swiftly, without fear or pain, either by hand or by the hands of someone we have witnessed do it. It must be done in a way that does not traumatize the animal’s companions.</p>

<p>We can separate animals into male and female groups, but we cannot separate them from companions in a way which would not have occurred in the wild. Bonded pairs must remain together always except through natural means (such as death). No part of the animal can be wasted, if it rots it has to be used for compost or to feed another animals capable of eating rotten food. We cannot eat bioengineered food that we can’t produce ourselves. And we have to give thanks to the animal for nourishing our bodies.</p>

<p>Killing our own food sounds simple enough, even sending animals to a slaughterer conscious of making the death swift…what I did not expect was how hard it would be to take the life of another living being with eyes that look upon me with trust.</p>

<h2 id="wagon-inspirations">Wagon Inspirations</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that I wanted to have a travelling monastery with livestock and gardens. There are a lot of practical reasons this might never take off, laws and urbanization being one of them. But it doesn’t mean I can’t implement prototypes of this concept on purchased or borrowed land.</p>

<p>I am inspired by the Gustafon family who by donkey and wagon and also keeps pigeons and chickens. The family utilizes multiple wagons. I envision multiple wagons pulled by a combination of ebikes and/or livestock - or - perhaps solar powered animatronics. Goats would be herded with the wagon and the livestock would be either horses, <del>camels</del>,  or Highland cattle.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/Gustafon_5b.webp" alt="Wagons" title="Wagons" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/gustafon8-DSCN4302c.jpeg" alt="Wagons" title="Wagons" /></p>

<p>In addition Aaron Fletcher who travels with his sheep and guerilla grazes, has also been an inspiration.
<img src="/assets/img/AaronFletcher1.jpg" alt="Wagons" title="Wagons" /></p>

<p>External design when camping would be much like this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yurt-unknown.jpg" alt="Trip" title="Trip" /></p>

<p>Interior design is also an elements for wagons would be designed with parkour in mind.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Playroom.jpeg" alt="Wagons" title="Wagons" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/90f6fb7d68a7861cd4f03bfde1e375e5.jpg" alt="Wagons" title="Wagons" /></p>

<p>Walls would comprise shelves with electronics and cookware firmly attached.  And I imagine a ‘trailer’ of some sort that is 24ft long, 13.5ft high, 8.5ft wide, that is 270sqft, including any lofts - numbers I got from a tiny housing community, where one individual wanted her trailer to be street legal.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/stout-300x300.jpg" alt="Wagons" title="Wagons" /></p>

<p>A combination of: Bell tent, yurts with reciprocal roofing, and tipis would be used for portable housing, but for stationary housing round houses made of mycelium bricks, straw, mud, tires, and/or earthbags would be used with reciprocal roofing.</p>

<h2 id="more-inspirations">More Inspirations</h2>

<p>A list of names of people or individuals who I have met or heard of who inspired my journey.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sunshine</strong> - was a support dog belonging to Joshua Rohrer, a homeless vet. She was hit by a car after being tased by a police officer. I met Sunshine once and she lit up my world. I struggle with agoraphobia and PTSD and had a panic attack out in the open, it was a year after my dog died and reeling from the loss of my kung fu family. Sunshine jumped up and rested her head onto my chest and helped me to calm down.</li>
  <li><strong>Vandwelling Gamer</strong> - He’s a youtuber who games with a desktop PC inside his van.</li>
  <li><strong>Gustafon Family</strong> - they travel by donkeys and wagons. Another family which wrote a book on Wagon Travel also inspired me, but I can’t remember their name! I learned about them through the longridersguild.</li>
  <li><strong>Aaron Fletcher</strong> - He is home-free and travels by sheep and small wagon. I am unlikely to meet him but he has been an inspiration to me.</li>
  <li><strong>The Tipi Family</strong> - there was a family who  lived in a Tipi for a few years.</li>
  <li><strong>Caveman Bill</strong> - My trip in 2020 was to head up to Dawson Creek and meet Caveman Bill. I don’t think I’ll ever get to  meet him.</li>
  <li><strong>Home-free computer programmer</strong> - there was a programmer who lived in a tent out in the woods with his laptop doing programming work. I don’t remember his name, but I remember his story.</li>
  <li><strong>Man who traveled by donkey</strong> -  There is a man who travels by donkey but I can’t remember what his name is. There are so many travellers by donkey! I ran into him one day on the road but never spoke to him as he was in road traffic. Another man traveled by horse and got wrecked, and there is another man who travels by donkey or did in the forests of Asheville.</li>
  <li><strong>The Long Riders Guild</strong> - I had wanted to meet Claire Burges Watson and Bernice Ende, I had also hoped to get in touch with a long rider to see if any would give me any tips. I reached out through the website and didn’t hear back. Bernice Ende passed away October 2, 2021 in New Mexico, I never did figure out how to contact Claire and another inspiring story for me are the Brazilian long-riders who rode from America all the way to Brazil.</li>
  <li><strong>Jacque Fresco</strong> - I really wanted to meet Jacque fresco and his friend Roxanne Meadows, but I never got the chance to as he died May 18th, 2017, I was still practicing martial arts.</li>
  <li><strong>Daniel Suelo</strong> -  I was just a child when I read about Daniel Suelo, the man who gave up money and lived in a Cave. He takes care of his mom now but still upcycles everything around him, he has a youtube channel that I occasionally frequent. He is also very spiritual. I tried to be 100% money-free.</li>
  <li><strong>Charlene Swankie</strong> - a vandweller and friend of mine who kayaked all 50 states after her husband’s passing. I met her back before I had children and was trying to vandwell with my rats. The Vandwelling tribe accepted me with open arms into their group. I got lost in my journeys after deleting all my social media accounts and ended up exploring wagons and buses. Now the community is saturated with spin-off vandwellers and groups, but this vandwelling tribe is OG.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions:</h2>

<p>Not on this list is Chris McCandless who inspired me, but whose lack of preparation and death has also frightened me as a cautionary tale. Another cautionary tale are the stories of families who have frozen to death in the Canadian winters. I wanted to travel in the dead of winter, with ‘romantic’ ideas of living close to the earth. Hunger, fending off bears and wolves, having broken limbs and not having the insulin needed for diabetic members of our family just doesn’t sound so appealing these days.</p>
